## 📝 Background Research
 After huge investment boom during the Covid-19, a lot of Koreans opened their eyes to investing their money. And as time goes by, individuals' portfolios are diversifying into various investment products such as bonds. (Sunghak Ahn, 2024) This is different when people put most of their money into stocks in the early days of the investment boom. But I think it's not enough because some of my peers, who's in mid 20s to late 20s women, still having lack of knowledge about investment products beyond than stocks.
 Referring to the personal experiences and the results of paper, women has less preferences in asset allocation in both risky assets and safe-heaven assets (Sujung Choi, 2023). Also, women showed a higher degree of risk aversion in general, and were less likely to take risks when their income and assets increased, compared to men (Daehwan Kim & Bongjoo Lee, 2023).
